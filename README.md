# Portfolio
AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed 
portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether 
they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, 
and links to sections about them, 
their work, 
and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

My project is a short webpage which describes me as a coder
I provided only 3 links because those have actual real work contained inside them.

Link to deployed app:
